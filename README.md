# Portfolio

Current portfolio using ReactJS.

## Introduction

Hello there! 

My name is Fabrizio, I'm from Argentina. This is my first year programming (I started on at the end of February 2022) so I decided to create a Portfolio to not only present myself but also keep updating it while learning new libraries.

## Why React JS?

I'm yet to see Angular or Vue (will do after backend) but right now, I'm prefering ReactJS over Vanilla JS  and that's why I decided to create my portfolio with ReactJS.

## Updates / Improvements

This portfolio will receive updates for sure (not only visually, code and more libraries will be implemented in the future).

Just to keep a record, I'll post each time a major update is implemented and which Libraries will be added.

## Current Dependencies

- MUI
- react-router-dom
- sass
- Animate.css
